*Exploratory analysis on flight destinations*  
# Business Goal  
Help an airline find meaningful customer segments to better target their current customers while marketing and to increase their loyalty membership program. 

# Overall Process  
1. First, I clustered the customers into meaningful groups based on similar flying traits.  
2. Next, I looked at how long it took to join the airline's membership program (Ufly).
3. Finally, combining the clustering solution with the Ufly membership analysis, I was able to recommend targeting 
specific clusters to improve Ufly membership and increase website bookings

# Results
1. Target Potential Elite members in “Frequent 1st-Class Flyers”. Potential Elite members took 7 to 9 flights with the airline.
Focusing on this cluster is advantageous because they are the highest spenders (based on average ticket price), 
Ufly Standard membership is high, yet Elite status is low, and customers are using Elite benefits, evidenced by purchasing first-class flights. 
Many Ufly Standard members and repeat flyers in this cluster are evidence of loyal customers. For the airline, targeting these customers 
means better customer relationships through stronger customer loyalty. Being the smallest cluster with 37,000 customers, the airline can effectively 
target a small number of customers to maximize its returns.

2. Incentivize current Ufly members in the “Outside Bookers” cluster to book through the airline's website by earning more points 
per flight purchase. “Outside Bookers” currently purchase 99% of tickets on outside booking channels.
Every outside booking takes away some revenue from the airline because the outside channels take a small cut of the ticket price. The airline
can target Ufly members, which is 11% of the cluster. Of the Ufly members, 36% are repeat flyers, whereas the cluster overall has 13% repeat 
flyers. Having the airline incentivize by earning more points on the airline's website, Ufly members in the “Outside Bookers” 
cluster benefit by earning more points from SCA Website booking than outside bookings. For the airline, targeting these customers means not 
sharing revenue with an outside booking organization, increased customer loyalty as the Ufly members will accumulate points to be redeemed on 
future flight tickets, and more efficiently targeting marketing to 42,000 customers instead of the entire cluster of 415,000 customers.
